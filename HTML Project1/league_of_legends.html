                        <li style="color: aliceblue;">The yordle pilot Corki loves two things above all others: flying <br> and his glamorous mustache... though not necessarily in that order. <br> After leaving Bandle City <br> he settled in Piltover and fell in love with the wondrous machines <br> he found there. <br> He dedicated himself to the development of flying contraptions <br> leading an aerial defense force of seasoned veterans known <br> as the Screaming Yipsnakes. <br> Calm under fire, Corki patrols the skies around his adopted home <br> and has never encountered a problem <br> that a good missile barrage couldn’t solve. <br></li>

                        <li style="color: aliceblue;">The yordle mage Lulu is known for conjuring dreamlike illusions and <br>fanciful creatures as she roams Runeterra with her fairy companion Pix. <br> Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world <br> and what she views as the constraints of this mundane <br> physical realm. While others might consider her magic at best unnatural <br> and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment. <br></li>

                        <li style="color: aliceblue;">Rumble is a young inventor with a temper. <br> Using nothing more than his own two hands and a heap of scrap <br> the feisty yordle constructed a colossal mech suit outfitted <br>with an arsenal of electrified harpoons and incendiary rockets. <br> Though others may scoff and sneer at his junkyard creations <br> Rumble doesn't mind—after all <br> he's the one with the flamespitter. <br></li>

                        <li style="color: aliceblue;">Undeterred by even the most dangerous and threatening of obstacles <br> Teemo scouts the world with boundless enthusiasm and a cheerful spirit. <br> A yordle with an unwavering sense of morality <br> he takes pride in following the Bandle Scout's Code <br> sometimes with such eagerness that he is unaware of the broader consequences <br> of his actions. <br> Though some say the existence of the Scouts is questionable <br> one thing is for certain: Teemo's conviction is nothing to be trifled with. <br></li>

                        <li style="color: aliceblue;">While many other yordles channel their energy into discovery <br> invention, or just plain mischief-making <br> Tristana was always inspired by the adventures of great warriors. <br> She had heard much about Runeterra, its factions, and its wars <br> and believed her kind could become worthy of legend too. <br> Setting foot in the world for the first time <br> she took up her trusty cannon Boomer <br> and now leaps into battle with steadfast courage and optimism. <br></li>

                        <li style="color: aliceblue;">Jayce is a brilliant inventor who has pledged his life <br> to the defense of Piltover and its unyielding pursuit of progress. <br> With his transforming hextech hammer in hand <br> Jayce uses his strength, courage <br> and considerable intelligence to protect his hometown. <br> While revered throughout the city as a hero <br> he hasn’t taken well to the attention heroism brings. <br> br Still, Jayce’s heart is in the right place <br> and even those who envy his natural skills <br> are grateful for his protection in the City of Progress. <br></li>
